# Dotnet Vertical Slice

This project aimed to help developers use "Vertical Slice" architecture 
I like to avoid using external dependencies except the "Fluent Validation" library which I love and I used it in this project.

Python "Django", "NestJS" or "Angular" frameworks follow a Modular architecture. Fortunately, recently .NET community has paid more attention to modular architecture with the raise of "Vertical Slice".
"Vertical Slice" gives you much more Cohesion over classic layered architectures. You can find files right where you need them. You can achieve excellent decoupling with the separation of layers inside modules.
